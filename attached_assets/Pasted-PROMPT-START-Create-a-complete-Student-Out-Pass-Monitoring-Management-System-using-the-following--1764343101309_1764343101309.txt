PROMPT START
Create a complete Student Out-Pass Monitoring & Management System using the following stack:
Backend: Java (Servlets + JDBC)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database: MySQL

Extra: QR Code generation + QR scanning using webcam

Architecture: Proper folder structure (MVC-like)

The system must support three roles: Student, Warden, and Security Guard.

1. STUDENT MODULE
Login
Students must log in using:

USN (as username)

Password

Features
View Dashboard

Apply for Out-Pass

Input fields: Reason, Date, Time

Each new request should automatically generate a unique PassID

Example: PASS0001, PASS0002, PASS0003…

Students can check status:

Pending

Approved

Rejected

Once approved:

A QR Code must be generated

QR should contain:

 {
  "passId": "PASS00123",
  "usn": "4CE23CS045"
}

Students can show the QR at the security gate.


2. WARDEN MODULE
Login
Username

Password

Features
View all pending student pass requests

Approve or reject each request

On approval, system must activate QR code for that PassID

Warden should be able to see:

Student details

Reason

Date & time

Status history


3. SECURITY GUARD MODULE
Login
Username

Password

Features
A dedicated “Scan QR” page

Use a JS library like html5-qrcode to access webcam and scan

When QR is scanned:

Extract PassID & USN

Send to backend servlet for validation

Backend must check:

If PassID exists

If approved by warden

If not expired or already used

Output must show:

“ALLOW ENTRY/EXIT” (green)

“INVALID / UNAPPROVED / ALREADY USED” (red)

Security can mark the pass as Used after scanning.


4. DATABASE STRUCTURE
Tables to create
students

usn (PK)

name

password

dept

semester

phone

wardens

username (PK)

password

security

username (PK)

password

outpass_requests

pass_id (PK)

usn (FK)

reason

date

time_out

status (pending/approved/rejected)

qr_code (base64 optional)

used_flag (0/1)


5. BACKEND REQUIREMENTS
Create servlets:
StudentServlet → login, apply pass, view status

WardenServlet → approve/reject

SecurityServlet → validate PassID and mark used

QRGeneratorServlet → generate QR code image on approval

DBConnection.java → MySQL connection

Use JSP or HTML pages for UI and servlets for backend logic.
 Use session handling for authentication.

6. FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS
Clean UI with HTML + CSS

Student dashboard

Warden approval dashboard

QR scanning page using webcam

Display alerts and status clearly

Responsive layout


7. EXTRA FEATURES (Optional but recommended)
Email/SMS notification (simulation)

Pass history for students

Dark mode

Dashboard charts

Auto-refresh for warden panel


8. DELIVERABLES
Generate:
All JSP/HTML pages

All Java Servlet files

QR generation code

QR scanning implementation

MySQL table creation SQL

Folder structure

How to run instructions
